# Antipatterns

Every file in this directory contains a description of a single
antipattern - a design tenet that sound be avoided.

These files will describe what their antipattern is, then why it's an
antipattern. They should also include the date the antipattern was
adopted, in `YYYY-MM-DD` form, and the person or people who wrote up
the description.
