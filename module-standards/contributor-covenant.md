# Contributor Covenant

All modules should have a Code of Conduct based on
the [Contributor Covenant][], because this project gets better the
more diverse the people in it are (and frankly because every human
deserves to feel safe). This is in line with the diversity principle:
Stratic prioritizes safety and inclusion over everything else,
including [free speech][].

Modules associated directly with the Stratic
project should have the contact email set to "alex@strugee.net";
otherwise, the author should use their best judgment.
