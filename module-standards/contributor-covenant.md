# Contributor Covenant

All modules should have a Code of Conduct based on
the [Contributor Covenant][], because this project gets better the
more diverse the people in it are (and frankly because every human
deserves to feel safe). Modules associated directly with the Stratic
project should have the contact email set to "alex@strugee.net";
otherwise, the author should use their best judgement.
