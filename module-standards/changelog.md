# Changelog

Every Stratic project should have a changelog at
`CHANGELOG.md`. Changelogs should follow the format proposed by
https://keepachangelog.com for consistency.

This is important because otherwise users can't tell what new features
or breaking changes they should be aware of between versions, so
upgrading becomes difficult and error-prone for them. See
https://keepachangelog.com for more.
