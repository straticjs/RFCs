# Module standards

Every file in this directory contains a description of an attribute
all Stratic modules should have, and why. They should also mention
whether [stratic-lint-module][] can check for that attribute.

They should also include the date the the standard was adopted, in
`YYYY-MM-DD` form, and the person or people who wrote up the
description.
