# GitHub topics

Stratic modules hosted on GitHub should always have the `stratic` and
`javascript` topics added (GitHub topics are the "tags" that you can
apply to repositories). This improves module discoverability.

Additionally, you should apply the `gulp` topic if it's a gulp-related
module, and the `gulp-plugin` topic if it actually handles gulp
streams. Most Stratic modules will apply both of these topics.

The author should also apply any other topics that they feel are
relevant (for example, `stratic-indexes-to-rss` has the `rss` topic
applied).
