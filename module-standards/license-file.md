# License

All Stratic modules should have a license so it's legal for people to
actually use the module. Though copyright holders are (of _course_)
free to [choose their own license][choosealicense], LGPL 3.0+ is the
recommended license because [freedom][] is important. It's also nice
because it ensures that derivative code can make it back to the
Stratic project and make it better.
