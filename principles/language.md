# Language choice

Stratic is written in pure JavaScript. This is because several
features of JavaScript, the Node.js platform, and the npm community
map very well to Stratic's design:

* JavaScript makes working with asynchronous things very natural
* A weakly typed language makes it much easier to have loose property
  name conventions as opposed to something stricter
* Node.js's streams API is best-in-class, especially in
  readability/ease-of-use
* npm's culture very strongly emphasizes "do one thing and do it well"

That being said, the thing that fundamentally makes Stratic
interesting is its design and principles, not the language it's
written in. So we welcome alternative implementations in different
languages - if you write a PyStratic or Stratic.rb, we'd love to hear
about it, link to you and keep collaborating on good design.
