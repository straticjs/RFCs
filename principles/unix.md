# Unix

Unix had it right. Simplicity and modularity lead to good software
design.

There are a _lot_ of parallels with Unix that could be made explicit
here, but rather than reenumerate the Unix philosophy for the
umpteenth time, it's probably better to just leave this quote from
Doug McIlroy, inventor of the Unix pipe:

> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do
it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle
text streams, because that is a universal interface.

It is left as an exercise for the reader to discover just how deeply
ingrained the Unix philosophy is in Stratic's design.
