# Diversity

Diversity is good. The more diversity there is, the better the design
of the project becomes because it takes into account more usecases.

Diversity can take many forms; here are some examples:

* Diversity in the population segments that contributors come from
* Diversity of thought with regards to what good design looks like
* Diversity of needs from the software

This project will intentionally prioritize safety and inclusivity over
everything else, including free speech, in order to promote diversity.
