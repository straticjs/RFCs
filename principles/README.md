# Core project principles

Every file in this directory contains a description of a core
principle that Stratic is designed around. These are fundamentally
what Stratic is about, and drive the design of everything else in this
repository. As such they are extremely important to the project.

These files will describe the principle itself, and why it's
important. They should also include the date the principle was
adopted, in `YYYY-MM-DD` form, and the person or people who wrote up
the description.

Principles here will very, very rarely be modified or added to - most
things belong in more specific parts of this repository. If patterns,
antipatterns, and module standards are Stratic's laws, these
principles are its constitution.
