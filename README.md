# Stratic RFCs repository

By its very nature, Stratic is a project broken up into many
repositories. Because of this, it's difficult to track things that
apply to the entire project.

This repository is designed to fill that gap. It provides a place to
discuss the evolution of the project's design, as well as a place to
track project-wide issues that haven't yet been turned into concrete
proposals.

## Contributing

Everyone should feel free to add new things to
the [issue tracker][]. This is great for:

1. Discussing features we should figure out how to do in the Stratic
   model
2. Highlighting pain points we should try to improve
3. Anything else that would require changes across multiple modules

Stratic is (among other things) about doing design the Right
Wayâ„¢. That means that any feedback, positive or negative, is really
important. The more diverse the people and viewpoints, the better the
project will be.

If you have a more concrete proposal, you could also send
a [Pull Request][].
