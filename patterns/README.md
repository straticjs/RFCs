# Patterns

Every file in this directory contains a description of a single
pattern - some design tenet that the Stratic project should strive to achieve.

These files will describe what their pattern is, then why it's a good
idea. They should also include the date the pattern was adopted, in
`YYYY-MM-DD` form, and the person or people who wrote up the
description.
